            <h1 id="heading">Essentials that should be present in your cleanser</h1><p>A cleanser for oily skin should be oil-free, lightweight, and pH-balanced (4.5-5.5) to control excess oil without over-drying. It should contain Salicylic Acid or Glycolic Acid to unclog pores and reduce breakouts, Niacinamide to regulate sebum production, and Clay or Charcoal to absorb excess oil. Tea Tree Oil and Green Tea Extract provide antibacterial and soothing effects, while Aloe Vera and Hyaluronic Acid maintain hydration. A gel-based or foaming formula, free from sulfates and alcohol, ensures deep cleansing without irritating the skin.</p></div>

            <p>
                A toner for oily skin should be oil-controlling, pore-tightening, and refreshing without stripping moisture. It should contain Salicylic Acid or Witch Hazel to reduce excess oil and unclog pores, Niacinamide to regulate sebum production, and Green Tea Extract or Tea Tree Oil for antibacterial and soothing properties. Aloe Vera and Hyaluronic Acid provide light hydration, while Antioxidants like Vitamin C protect against environmental damage. An alcohol-free, lightweight, and non-comedogenic formula helps maintain a balanced, shine-free complexion.

Hyaluronic Acid provides hydration without greasiness, while Green Tea Extract and Tea Tree Oil offer anti-inflammatory and antibacterial benefits. Vitamin C and antioxidants protect against environmental damage, and light exfoliants like Lactic Acid help maintain a smooth, clear complexion. A non-comedogenic, fast-absorbing formula is ideal for oil control and acne prevention.</p></div>

            <p>
                A moisturizer for oily skin should be lightweight, oil-free, and non-comedogenic to provide hydration without clogging pores or making the skin greasy. Hyaluronic Acid and Glycerin help retain moisture without adding excess oil, while Niacinamide regulates sebum production and minimizes pores. Aloe Vera and Green Tea Extract soothe the skin and reduce inflammation, while Zinc and Witch Hazel help control shine and prevent breakouts. Ingredients like Salicylic Acid gently exfoliate and keep pores clear, making it ideal for acne-prone skin. A gel-based or water-based formula is best as it absorbs quickly, leaving the skin feeling fresh, hydrated, and matte.

        <div class="text"><h1 id="heading">Essentials that should be present in your sunscreen</h1><p>A sunscreen for oily skin should be lightweight, oil-free, and non-comedogenic to prevent clogged pores and excess shine. It should have SPF 30+ or higher for effective sun protection, with broad-spectrum coverage (UVA & UVB). Mattifying ingredients like Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, or Silica help absorb excess oil and keep the skin shine-free. Gel-based or water-based formulas with ingredients like Niacinamide regulate sebum production, while Green Tea Extract and Vitamin E provide antioxidant protection. Sweat-resistant and fragrance-free formulas ensure long-lasting wear without irritation, keeping the skin protected, fresh, and matte throughout the day.</p></div></div>
