It should contain mineral filters like Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide, which are less likely to cause irritation compared to chemical filters. Soothing ingredients such as Aloe Vera, Centella Asiatica, Green Tea Extract, and Oat Extract help calm the skin, while hydrators like Hyaluronic Acid and Glycerin maintain moisture. A fragrance-free, alcohol-free, non-comedogenic, and hypoallergenic formula is essential to prevent irritation and keep sensitive skin comfortable and protected throughout the day.</p></div>
