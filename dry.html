It should contain hydrating agents like Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Aloe Vera, and Honey to retain moisture, nourishing ingredients such as Shea Butter, Squalane, and Ceramides to strengthen the skin barrier, and soothing components like Colloidal Oatmeal, Chamomile Extract, and Cucumber Extract to reduce irritation. A good cleanser for dry skin should be fragrance-free, sulfate-free, and alcohol-free, ensuring a soft, smooth, and well-hydrated complexion without tightness or discomfort.</p>
