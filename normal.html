            <h1 id="heading">Essentials that should be present in your cleanser</h1>
            <p>A cleanser for normal skin should be gentle, hydrating, and pH-balanced (5.5-6.5) to maintain the skin’s natural barrier without stripping moisture. 
            Key ingredients include hydrators like glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and aloe vera, gentle surfactants like cocamidopropyl betaine, and antioxidants such as vitamin C and green tea extract for protection. 
            It should be free from sulfates, alcohol, artificial fragrances, and harsh chemicals to prevent irritation. The best cleanser types for normal skin include gel, cream, or mild foaming cleansers that effectively cleanse while keeping the skin balanced and healthy.</p>

            <p>A toner for normal skin should be hydrating, balancing, and refreshing, helping to maintain the skin’s natural moisture and pH levels. 
            It should contain hydrating agents like Aloe Vera, Hyaluronic Acid, and Cucumber Extract to keep the skin plump and nourished, along with gentle astringents such as Rose Water and Green Tea Extract to tone and refine pores. 
            Additionally, pH balancers like Apple Cider Vinegar (diluted) or Alcohol-Free Witch Hazel help maintain skin health, while antioxidants like Vitamin C and Vitamin E protect against environmental damage. 
            To prevent dryness or irritation, it’s best to choose an alcohol-free formula for a natural, glowing complexion.</p>
