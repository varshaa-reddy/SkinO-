            <h1 id="heading">Essentials that should be present in your cleanser</h1><p>A cleanser for combination skin should effectively balance oil production while maintaining hydration. It should include gentle surfactants like Cocamidopropyl Betaine to cleanse without stripping moisture, hydrating agents like Glycerin and Hyaluronic Acid to retain hydration in dry areas, and oil-controlling ingredients like Niacinamide, Green Tea Extract, or Salicylic Acid to regulate excess sebum in oily zones. Additionally, antioxidants such as Vitamin C and Aloe Vera soothe and protect the skin, while avoiding harsh sulfates, alcohol, and artificial fragrances helps maintain the skinâ€™s natural barrier. A gel-based or mild foaming cleanser is ideal for keeping the skin fresh, balanced, and healthy.</p></div></div>

            <p>
                A toner for combination skin should balance oil and hydration while keeping the skin refreshed and soothed. It should contain hydrating ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe Vera, and Glycerin to nourish dry areas, while oil-controlling agents like Niacinamide, Green Tea Extract, and Witch Hazel help regulate excess sebum in oily zones. Gentle exfoliants such as Lactic Acid or PHA (Polyhydroxy Acid) can help unclog pores and smooth the skin without over-drying. Additionally, antioxidants like Vitamin C and Chamomile Extract protect the skin from environmental stress. An alcohol-free formula is best to prevent irritation and maintain skin balance.
