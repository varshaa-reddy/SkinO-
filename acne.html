            <p> Acne-prone normal skin benefits from salicylic acid, which penetrates deep into the pores to remove excess oil and clear clogged pores, preventing breakouts. Niacinamide controls oil production, reduces redness, and strengthens the skin barrier. Green tea extract is rich in antioxidants, helping to reduce inflammation and fight acne-causing bacteria. Aloe vera provides lightweight hydration, soothes irritation, and speeds up healing without making the skin greasy. Use a gentle foaming cleanser, a lightweight serum with these actives, and a non-comedogenic moisturizer.</p>

            <p>To treat acne on dry skin, focus on hyaluronic acid, a powerful humectant that attracts moisture to the skin without clogging pores, keeping the skin hydrated and plump. Niacinamide helps reduce inflammation and strengthens the skin barrier, preventing further dryness. Ceramides restore the skinâ€™s protective layer, preventing irritation from acne treatments. Azelaic acid fights acne-causing bacteria, brightens dark spots left by pimples, and soothes redness without over-drying. Look for a hydrating gel-based cleanser, a lightweight, non-alcoholic toner, and a barrier-repairing moisturizer.</p>

            <h1 id="heading">Essentials that should be used for Oily skin</h1>
            <p>Oily skin requires salicylic acid, a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that deeply exfoliates, removes dead skin cells, and unclogs pores to prevent acne. Niacinamide regulates sebum production, reducing shine and excessive oil buildup. Benzoyl peroxide kills acne-causing bacteria and reduces the size of pimples quickly, while witch hazel acts as a natural astringent to control oil and reduce inflammation. Use a gel-based foaming cleanser, an oil-free niacinamide serum, and a lightweight gel moisturizer with mattifying properties.</p>

            <h1 id="heading">Essentials that should be used for combination skin</h1>
            <p>Treating acne on combination skin requires balancing hydration and oil control. Salicylic acid should be used on the oily T-zone to prevent clogged pores and breakouts, while hyaluronic acid ensures the drier areas remain hydrated. Niacinamide is an excellent all-rounder that helps balance oil production, reduce redness, and strengthen the skin barrier. Green tea extract provides antioxidant protection and soothes irritated skin. Use a gentle, balancing cleanser, a spot treatment with salicylic acid for oily areas, and a lightweight moisturizer suitable for both oily and dry zones.</p>

            <p>Acne treatment for sensitive skin should be extra gentle to avoid irritation. Aloe vera hydrates and soothes redness, preventing inflammation caused by acne. Centella asiatica, also known as "cica," repairs and strengthens the skin barrier while calming irritation. Azelaic acid is a mild yet effective antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent that fights acne while reducing redness and pigmentation. Chamomile extract provides extra soothing benefits, helping to calm flare-ups and skin sensitivity. Use a fragrance-free, non-foaming cleanser, a calming serum with centella or aloe, and a gentle, non-comedogenic moisturizer.</p>
